Given time: 60 min
Leftover time: 13 mins

I wrote down everything in psuedocode but I still had trouble translating it to code.
Dan helped me sort out my thoughts and I was able to code everything in 10 mins. The rest of the time I used to prepare and understand the problem. I thought this problem would be hard, but once I started coding, it ended up being easier than I expected.
